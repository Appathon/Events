<h3>ABA-MIT Appathon Project: 3D Printing Code of Conduct</h3>
<b>Summary</b>
<p>Lead: Aamir Rahman<p>
<p>Theme: Technology, Rules and Regulations</p>
<p>Working on behalf of 3D Hubs and together with students at the University of Amsterdam, we are working to create a Code of Conduct for users in the 3D printing community. We would like to create a website where standards and laws from different countries (starting with the US and EU) can be easily accessed by anyone around the world. Although there are countless benefits that can be attributed to the emergence of 3D printers, there are a handful of issues that may arise in the areas of intellectual property law, tort law, criminal law, health law and privacy law. We are putting together the laws as well as standards as to how individuals who own 3D printers agree not to use their devices.</p>
