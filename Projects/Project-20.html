<h2>Summary</h2>
<h3>Lead: Lili, Phil, Ed </h3>
<h3>Theme: Technology, Legal Education</h3>
<p>
LawSTAR is an Interactive and efficient online resource - for Law Students, by Law Students.
<br>
We are millennials who encapsulate the entrepreneurial spirit of our generation. As law students in New York City, we live and breathe the rapid and innovative changes that shape this city. The field of law has a reputation of being stiffly unresponsive to technological developments, resulting in lawyers being left out of modern technological and social trends.
<br>
LawSTAR looks to bring technology, efficiency, and accessibility to a community of our peers in order to improve our student experience and access a platform to exchange materials.
<br>
Other online websites do currently attempt to address certain aspects of this need, but they often feature unwieldy flaws, such as lacking search features or total absence of UI development that donâ€™t maximize utility. In other words, they poorly execute some otherwise great ideas. Other sites lack our multidimensional service, superior content, and the user experience and efficiency that the millennial law student desires.
<br>We plan to create the ultimate online platform and application that uses peer-to-peer exchange between law students starting in New York City. Through this resource, students will be able to offer and access course materials, reviews/evaluations, news, ideas and most importantly - each other.
