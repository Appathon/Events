<h3>ABA-MIT Appathon Project: Legal Capture</h3>
<b>Summary</b>
<p>Lead: Ben Brash<p>
<p>Theme: Technology</p>
Every year law enforcement officers issue millions of tickets for parking, traffic, and low-level criminal infractions . Many individuals who receive those tickets do not know all the legal remedies available to fight the tickets or the ramifications of pleading guilty. The sheer volume of tickets issued creates inefficient interactions for citizens with the justice system. The system, its rules, and penalties are confusing and not created for the digital age. Using smartphone image capture technology, in conjunction with machine learning, Legal Capture is designed to be an incredible resource for people who receive tickets or citations for minor infractions. Users can learn about the statutes they violated, potential fines and penalties, common defenses, and real-time evidence gathering to begin the process of contesting these tickets, all from their smartphones.
