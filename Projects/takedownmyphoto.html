<p>The Legal Hackers devised a system called Take My Photo Down that can send an automatic letter to the platform that is hosting the pornography and order them to take it down, or be subject to damages, he said. The “tougher question” is, however, instilling authorship in a photo taken by someone else, he noted. Generally, “revenge porn” is comprised of sexual or lewd photographs taken by oneself of oneself (“Selfies”) and then sent to another person via text message or email. In Selfies, the person taking the photograph is the same person that is in the photograph. The person who receives these photographs then posts them to the Internet without the permission of the person in the photograph (and who took the photograph), thereby turning a “Selfie” into revenge porn.
