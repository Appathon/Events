<h3>ABA-MIT Appathon Project: Free Legal</h3>
<b>Summary</b>
<p>Lead: Andrew Braunstein<p>
<p>Theme: Technology</p>
<p>In the currently saturated legal market, it is increasingly difficult to find “the needle in the haystack” - attorneys and legal resources that address each consumer’s unique needs, including expertise in a specific area of law, geographic reach, and often most importantly, cost.

Free Legal hopes to provide more direct, more streamlined, and more effective access to justice for those who need it most.</p>
