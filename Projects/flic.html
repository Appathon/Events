<p>FLIC stands for the Film Legal Information Center. FLIC is an app designed to organize all of the business and legal needs of indie film artists and game designers into one environment. Users have the opportunity to view a library of informative videos and blogs, book and participate in live discussions specific to the issues of your project. You can also populate, sign, email, and print contracts from within the mobile app. FLIC is more than just a series of templates; documents are customizable and adaptable to meet the parameters of your film or digital arts project.
