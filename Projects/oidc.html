<h3>ABA-MIT Appathon Project: Municipal OIDC Identity Provider</h3>
<b>Summary</b>
<p>Lead: Evan Absher, Doug Seacord, Paul Barham<p>
<p>Theme: Data Security & Personal Data Mgmt</p>
<p>Should and can a Municipality become an Identity Provider in the OIDC context? Can a municipality help construct an architecture to create and protect substantive data rights? Will a municipality better align the the interests of the users, businesses, and public entities? Can a municipality technically handle being an IdP?
<br>
We want to create a municipal IdP with a word press site.
