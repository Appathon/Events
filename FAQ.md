The Following is a Draft from Februry
MIT and ABA teamed in March and this draft does not yet reflect use of the MIT Online Legal Hackathon approach.

## Under Development

LTRC APPATHON (DURING TECHSHOW 2015)
Organizers: The ABA Legal Technology Resource Center Board Members: Adriana Linares, Dennis Kennedy, Rodney Dowell 

What is a hackathon and specifically, a “legal” hackathon?

A legal hackathon is an event that brings together teams of lawyers, policymakers, academics, and technologists to develop innovative, on-the-spot solutions to challenging legal issues. We are going to call our event an “appathon”. 

Generally a theme is announced and in past legal hackathons that has focused on access to justice. Ours will be geared toward developing a tool, a widget, an app that helps lawyers, our general target audience.
Take a look at this “Multiple Bill Calculator” built by Loyola Law students and professor:

** About Multiple Bill Calculator **

Louisiana's Habitual Offender Law provides for enhanced sentences for offenders with previous felony convictions. Properly computing the correct sentences, however, requires the one skill that most lawyers are not particularly good at - math.
This is where Multiple Bill Calculator steps in. It uses javascript to quickly calculate the minimum and maximum sentencing ranges for multiple offenders. The calculator works on any device with a browser - phones, tablets, and desktop computers - and even works when you have no internet connection. The calculator is open source and is offered free of charge by the Loyola Litigation and Technology Clinic under the MIT license. The source code is available on Github.

During the hackathon, lawyers, law students, developers and graphic designers work in “teams”. Each team will work to develop a web application or mobile app over the course of the hackathon. At the end of the hackathon, a panel of judges will rate each of the teams' work, and a winning app will be chosen.
We would solicit ideas for problems that the teams can work to resolve ahead of the kickoff through LTRC. 
What is the goal of the LTRC appathon?
To develop a fully functional widget or app that will be housed on the LTRC website. The longer term goal would be to develop an actual app for mobile devices but that may be too lofty a goal for this first event. 
Where will it be held and when?
After the Wednesday night reception at Techshow
 
Time Schedule: Wed
Time	Description
7:00 PM	Check-in begins for non-reception attendees
7:30 PM	Event kickoff
7:45-9:00 PM	Pitches, project selection and group brainstorming
9:00PM	Hacking begins for through Fri eve.

When and where does the actual hacking/coding happen?
The teams will go or be off-site. We are hoping to involve remote teams that don’t or won’t need to be in Chicago.

Who determines the “winner”?
The winning app (possibly apps?) will be chosen by a group of selected judges. First thoughts: Ed Walters, Bob Ambrogi, Jack Newton, Marc Lauritsen . Perhaps a poll on LTRC?

When will the winning app/be announced?
During the end of Techshow announcements on Saturday.

What will come of the winning app?
It will be showcased on LTRC, drawing traffic and interest to the resource center.

Who will own the app and be responsible for updating it?
LTRC will “own” the app and be responsible for its maintenance. (???)
Will there be sponsors?

Hopefully, but I need to work through the Techshow board for this. We don’t want to step on their toes about this. I’m talking to Steve and Brett now about how to handle.

What are the rules and regulations?
Drafting those now – soon to come.

How are teams formed?
Teams will be formed ahead of time by working with the local legal coding community. Dennis Kennedy suggested having teams apply to participate.

Who will do the “coding” and can it be done in 48 hours?
Hackathons are generally run over a one or two day period can certainly end in the development of a fully functional products.

What makes up a team?
Law students, coders, lawyers and other interested experts. 

What are team leaders?
A team leader will be selected to act as the spokesperson and communicator for the team.

How will the winners be compensated?
Working on this –ideas…..Free registration to next year’s Techshow? Cash prizes? Subscriptions to legal technology tools?

What are the Techshow participants going to be doing?
The reception participants will be asked to help choose the projects and then brainstorm with the teams before they deploy to their remote hacking locations. 

What resources from the Techshow staff will we need in advance and during?
Minimal – we are  happy to take this on and work with LTRC staff. Surely I will need to work with Cindy on the logistics of the room. 

How will this affect TECHSHOW?
The only on-site event will only be the kick-off on Wednesday evening. The rest of the event will be virtual as teams will be remote, activity will be limited to online events (Twitter, LTRC, etc)

How will attendees participate?
On-site attendees will only be involved during the kick-off. After that, they can participate as they like via online activities.

How will it be marketed?
LTRC, Techshow outlets as much as the Board would like, Twitter, participant social media properties
What platforms/devices will the app be available for?
The goal is to build a web-based, browser agnostic app/widget. The long term goal (lets call it “Phase 2” – would be to have a mobile app for ios and android devices that LTRC would publish).
